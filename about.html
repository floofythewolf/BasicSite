    <h2>Why This Website?</h2>
    <p>
        I created this website to help beginners understand the fundamentals of web development. It aims to provide simple and clear explanations of <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>—three core technologies in web development. Web development can seem intimidating, so I wanted to make it approachable for everyone, whether they are completely new to coding or just need a refresher.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Approach Works</h2>
    <p>
        The website presents HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a structured manner, guiding users from simple concepts to more complex ones. Interactive examples encourage hands-on learning, making coding less abstract. Visual demonstrations allow users to see the immediate effects of their changes.

  <h2>Why HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?</h2>
  <p>
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the core technologies used to build websites. Each of these technologies plays a unique role in web development:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>HTML</strong>: The backbone of any webpage, providing structure and content.</li>
      <li><strong>CSS</strong>: Used for styling the webpage, including fonts, colors, layouts, and more.</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Adds interactivity to the webpage, allowing for dynamic content like animations, form validation, and user input handling.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      This website guides you through the basics of each technology, helping you understand their roles and how they work together.
